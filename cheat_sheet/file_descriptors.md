# File Descriptors

In operating systems, file descriptors are integer values used to identify and access opened files or input/output sources. They serve as a communication interface between the operating system and files or devices. File descriptors are typically represented as non-negative integers.

Commonly used file descriptors include:

| File Descriptor | Description                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 0               | Standard Input (stdin)                  |
| 1               | Standard Output (stdout)                |
| 2               | Standard Error (stderr)                 |
| ...             | ...                                    |

Here is a brief explanation of each file descriptor:

- **Standard Input (stdin)** (File Descriptor 0): It is the default input stream for reading data from the user or other sources. In Unix-like systems, it is typically associated with the keyboard.

- **Standard Output (stdout)** (File Descriptor 1): It is the default output stream for writing data. It is often used to display program output or write data to the console.

- **Standard Error (stderr)** (File Descriptor 2): It is the output stream for error messages or diagnostics. Error messages are usually separated from normal program output to facilitate error handling and debugging.

File descriptors beyond 2 are typically used to represent opened files or additional input/output sources. They can vary depending on the specific operating system and programming environment.

It's important to note that file descriptors are a low-level concept and are typically accessed through system calls or programming interfaces provided by the operating system. In high-level programming languages, abstractions such as file objects or streams are often used to handle file operations, which internally utilize file descriptors for communication with the underlying operating system.
